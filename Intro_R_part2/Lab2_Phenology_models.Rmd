### **Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to construct a simple process-based model in R  
- Import external data as a data frame and summarize its contents   
- Produce, visualize, and interpret degree-day model predictions  
- Describe how and why phenology varies both within and among years   

### **Grading Rubric**

Most of your grade will be for effort - i.e., that you did your best to follow instructions and to answer questions. The lab is worth 40 pts. Points may be deducted for errors in code, not following instructions, or answering questions incorrectly or incompletely. 

### **Instructions**

There are questions associated with each exercise below to complete either during class or on your own time. Record answers to the questions **within** the Markdown (`.Rmd`) file and record your name on line 2. Once you're done with the lab, knit the R markdown file as a Word document (`.docx`) within RStudio by clicking the `Knit` button found in the toolbar (look for a ball of yarn with a needle sticking out of it) and selecting `Knit to Word`. Ignore any warning messages that pop up in the Console during knitting. Submit the `.Rmd` **and** the `.docx` files on Canvas.

### **Introduction**

We will develop several **process-based** models in this course. In ecology, process-based models are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes. Relationships are described in terms of explicitly stated processes or mechanisms, and model parameters therefore have a clear ecological interpretation. An example of a  process-based model in ecology includes the process of how radiation, water, and temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis. Process-based models can have a spatial and/or temporal component. For example, you could use a process-based model for photosynthesis to study how rates differ across different latitudes or how they change over the course of a year.

For this lab, you will learn how to develop a process-based model that predicts degree-day accumulation over time. **Degree-day** models are often used to predict the phenology of ectothermic organisms (poikilothermic) such as insects, plants, and fungi. These organisms require a consistent amount of heat accumulation to reach certain life stages, such as egg hatch or adult flight for insects, or leaf out and flowering in plants. A **degree-day** is a measurement of heat units over time (i.e., heat accumulation), calculated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures ($T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$, respectively). DD models typically use a daily or hourly **time step**, meaning that DDs are calculated for each day or hour, respectively. The model tracks the accumulation of these DDs over a specific time period, such as a season or an entire year.

#### **Part 1: An Introduction to Modeling Degree-Days**

The $T_{min}$ at which an ectothermic organism begins to develop is called the “lower developmental threshold” ($LDT$), or baseline. The $T_{max}$ at which development stops is called the “upper developmental threshold ($UDT$),” or cutoff. The $LDT$ and $UDT$ vary among species, and have been determined for many economically important pests. 

Threshold values are used in calculating species-specific DDs. DD calculations are based on the area under the diurnal temperature curve and between the thresholds. A visual representation of DDs for two 24-hour periods is below. The area in black under the curve represents the number of DDs that fall between a $LDT$ and $UDT$, for each 24-hour period. A DD model assumes that the rate of development of an ectothermic organism is a straight line directly related to temperature.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Lab2_phenology_models", "example_plots", "DD_plot.png"))
```

#### **Simple Average**

DDs can be calculated using a simple formula for the average daily temperature, calculated from the daily $T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$, minus the $LDT$

[(daily $T_{max}$ + $T_{min}$)/2] – $LDT$

For example, a day where the high is 72$^\circ$F and the low is 44$^\circ$F would accumulate 8 DDs using 50$^\circ$F as the $LDT$:  

$$[(72 + 44)/2] – 50 = 8$$

For a site with $T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$ data available, the different methods for calculating DDs are single sine, double sine, single triangle, and double triangle. More complex DD equations may result in more precise DD estimates.

#### **Lower Developmental Threshold (LDT)**

In the following exercise, we will use the simple formula to calculate DDs using a $LDT$ of 50F. This $LDT$ is commonly used in DD models for plants and insect pests. The weather data used in our model is in degrees Fahrenheit. 

Below we create objects called `LDT50F` that defines the lower developmental threshold as 50F. Additionally, we get information on its class and specific data type. The $LDT50F$ is defined as `50` using the assignment operator `<-`.  

```{r}
# Lower development threshold
LDT50F  <- 50
```

**(1)** What is the class and specific data type of `LDT50F` object? Show your work in the code chunk below. (1 pt)

```{r}
# Class
class(LDT50F)

# Type
typeof(LDT50F)
```

*Response*: The class of LDT50F is numeric and the type is double.

**(2)** Say you're working on a species with an $LDT$ of 54F. In the code chunk below, create an object named `LDT54F` that defines this threshold. (1 pt)

```{r}
LDT54F <- 54
```

**(3)** In the code chunk below, calculate DDs using your two thresholds, `LDT50F` and `LDT54F`. Use `80.1` and `47.5` as $T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$, respectively. Which threshold resulted in a larger DD value and why? (2 pts)

```{r}
tmax <- 80.1
tmin <- 47.5
((tmax+tmin)/2)-LDT50F
## [1] 13.8
((tmax+tmin)/2)-LDT54F
## [1] 9.8
```

*Response*: 


#### **Importing and Formatting Weather Data**

Here we import weather data derived from an Agrimet station in Corvallis in 2021 (station ID = CRVO). The `here()` function is used to define project-relative paths for files. The weather data file (`CRVO21.txt`) is in the `weather_data` subfolder of `Lab2_intro_R_modeling`. 

```{r}
# Path of weather data file
weath_fl <- here("Lab2_model_building_R", "weather_data", "CRVO21.txt")
```

The weather data file is a space-delimited text file. We will import it using the [`read_table()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/2.1.3/topics/read_table) function from the [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package (part of tidyverse). The first row is skipped using `skip` (it has column headers) and the seventh column is skipped using `col_skip` (it only contain comments).

```{r}
# Import weather data
weath_tbl <- read_table(weath_fl, skip = 1, col_names = FALSE, 
                        col_types = cols(X7 = col_skip())) # Skip empty col 7
```

Next we convert the table to a data frame using the `data.frame()` function. Additionally, the `colnames()` function is used to define the column names.

```{r}
# Convert the table to a data frame and name the columns
weath_data <- data.frame(weath_tbl)
colnames(weath_data) <- c("month", "day", "tmax", "tmin", "prec", "dd50")
```

**(4)** In the code chunk below, use recently learned functions to get the dimensions and structure of the weather data. Next, write code to peek at the first and last 6 rows of data. You should have 4 lines of code. What are two things that you learned about the data set? (2 pts)

```{r}
# Dimensions
dim(weath_data)
# Structure
str(weath_data)
# Head
head(weath_data)
# Tail
tail(weath_data)
```

*Response*: The code should include the `dim()`, `str()`, `head()`, and `tail()` functions. The answer here may vary.


#### **The Daily Time Step**

The simple DD model will predict the development of a hypothetical organism in 2021. To do this, it will use a daily time step to calculate DDs for each day and accumulate these DDs over the entire year. In R, this can be accomplished using a `for` loop. First, we will specify the time period as the number of rows in the weather data.   

**(5)** In the code chunk below, create an object named `number_of_days` that uses the `nrow()` function to get this information. (1 pt)   

```{r}
# How many rows in the data frame?
number_of_days <- nrow(weath_data)
```

#### **Model Components**

The first part of the loop is below. Notice that we're using a variable named `i` as an index that is iteratively replaced by each value in the vector `1:number_of_days`. The loop starts with `1` and stops once it reaches the last value in `number_of_days`. An `if` statement is used to change negative DD values to `0` (negative DD values are not technically possible).
```{r}
# Step through days in year
for (i in 1:number_of_days) {
  
  # Tmin and Tmax for day of year
  tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
  tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
  
  # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
  dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT50F
  
  # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
  if (dd_today < 0) {
    dd_today <- 0
  }
}
```

The above model is incomplete because it's only calculating DDs for a single day. DD models work by accumulating DDs over time to predict phenology - i.e., predicting and tracking the development of an organism over a designated time frame. Thus, an object is needed to track DD accumulation, which we'll call `dd_accum`. 

```{r}
# Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
dd_accum <- 0

# Step through days of year
for (i in 1:number_of_days) {

  # Tmin and Tmax for day of year
  tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
  tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
  
  # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
  dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT50F
  
  # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
  if (dd_today < 0) {
    dd_today <- 0
  }
  
  # Accumulate degree-days
  dd_accum <- dd_accum + dd_today
}
```

It's often helpful to store results of a model in a data frame that includes other information, such as the names of your study sites, sampling dates, etc. Below, we create an empty data frame to store results of the DD model. The first two columns simply copy the month and day from the input weather data (`month` and `month_day`), whereas the remaining columns store the DDs for each day (`dd_today`) and the total number of accumulated DDs (`dd_accum`). One way to [create an empty data frame](https://www.statology.org/create-empty-data-frame-in-r/) is to first make a matrix with a specified number of columns and rows, and then name the columns.  
```{r}
# Create an empty data frame to store accumulated DDs
out_all_LDT50 <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0))
colnames(out_all_LDT50) <- c("month", "month_day", "dd_today", "dd_accum")
```

Over the daily time step, results of the model for each day of year (`i`) will be saved in a single row. Two columns extract month (`month`) and day of the month (`month_day`) information from the weather data using `i` as an index. The `$` symbols signifies a column.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Put results for day of year in a data frame
out_i <- data.frame("doy" = i, 
                    "month" = weath_data$month[i],
                    "month_day" = weath_data$day[i],
                    "dd_today" = dd_today,
                    "dd_accum" = dd_accum)
```

Results for each day are tacked onto the `out_all_LTD50` data frame using the [`bind_rows()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html) function in the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package (part of Tidyverse). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Attach results for day to all results 
out_all_LDT50 <- bind_rows(out_all_LDT50, out_i) 
```

#### **Run the DD Model Using a LDT of 50$^\circ$F**

The entire DD model is below.

```{r}
# Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
dd_accum <- 0

# Step through days of year
for (i in 1:number_of_days) {

  # Tmin and Tmax for day of year
  tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
  tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
  
  # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
  dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT50F
  
  # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
  if (dd_today < 0) {
    dd_today <- 0
  }
  
  # Accumulate degree-days
  dd_accum <- dd_accum + dd_today
  
  # Put results for day in a data frame
  out_i <- data.frame("doy" = i,
                      "month" = weath_data$month[i],
                      "month_day" = weath_data$day[i],
                      "dd_today" = dd_today,
                      "dd_accum" = dd_accum)
  
  # Attach results for day to all results 
  out_all_LDT50 <- bind_rows(out_all_LDT50, out_i) 

}
```

The `out_all_LDT50` data frame now contains DD results for each day of the year, as we can see by peeking at both the top and end of the data frame using `head()` and `tail()`, respectively. You can explore the data frame more thoroughly by clicking on it in the Environment tab of the Environment/History/etc. pane. 

**(6)** What was the minimum and maximum amount of DD accumulation for 2021? Hint: Use functions such as `min()` on `max()` for the `dd_accum` column of the `out_all_LDT50` data frame, or the `summary()` function for the entire data frame. (1 pt)

```{r}
# Min DD accum
min(out_all_LDT50$dd_accum)
# 0
# Max DD accum
max(out_all_LDT50$dd_accum)
# 2595.8
```

*Response*: 


#### **Run the DD Model Using a LDT of 54$^\circ$F**

**(7)** Compare model outputs produced using an LDT of 50F vs. 54F. The easiest way to do this is to simply copy/paste the previous code chunk and then replace the threshold value (hint: you defined it above, in **Q2**). However, you'll need a new data frame to store your results to avoid overwriting your previous results (i.e., `out_all_LDT50`). I did this part for you below. (5 pts)

```{r}
# Create an empty data frame to store accumulated DDs based on a LDT of 54F
out_all_LDT54 <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0))
colnames(out_all_LDT54) <- c("month", "month_day", "dd_today", "dd_accum")

# Now create and run your loop below
# Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
dd_accum <- 0

# Step through days of year
for (i in 1:number_of_days) {

  # Tmin and Tmax for day of year
  tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
  tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
  
  # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
  dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT54F
  
  # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
  if (dd_today < 0) {
    dd_today <- 0
  }
  
  # Accumulate degree-days
  dd_accum <- dd_accum + dd_today
  
  # Put results for day in a data frame
  out_i <- data.frame("doy" = i,
                      "month" = weath_data$month[i],
                      "month_day" = weath_data$day[i],
                      "dd_today" = dd_today,
                      "dd_accum" = dd_accum)
  
  # Attach results for day to all results 
  out_all_LDT54 <- bind_rows(out_all_LDT54, out_i) 

}
```

**(8)** What was the minimum and maximum amount of DD accumulation based on a LDT of 54F? (1 pt)

```{r}
min(out_all_LDT54$dd_accum)
# 0
max(out_all_LDT54$dd_accum)
# 1824.55
```

*Response*: Minimum DD accumulated for LDT54F is 0 and the maximum DD accumulated for LDT54F is 1824.55

**(9)** Which LDT resulted in higher DD accumulation? Explain the biological significance of this result. Specifically, explain what it signifies in terms of the organism's development for 2021. (2 pts)

*Response*: The organism with the lower LDT (LDT50F) had a higher DD accumulation. This is because they are able to begin developing at lower temperatures than the organism with LDT of 54F (LDT54F). Biologically, this implies that the lower LDT organism will have a faster rate of development over the course of 2021 as compared to the organism with the higher LDT.

### **Part 2: Modeling the Phenology of the Asian Longhorned Beetle**

### **Exercise 1: Model for a Single Year**

In the following exercise, we will use the simple formula to model the phenology of [Asian longhorned beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_long-horned_beetle), *Anoplophora glabripennis*. The Asian loghorned beetle is an invasive insect in North America that poses a serious threat to hardwood trees in natural and urban areas. It is found in parts of the northeastern U.S. and in Ontario, Canada. USDA APHIS  estimates that the beetle has the potential to cause more damage than Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight and gypsy moths combined.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "300px", fig.show="hold", fig.cap = "Adult Asian longhorned beetle (left) and tree damage caused by larvae (right). Source: https://natural-resources.canada.ca/"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here("Lab2_phenology_models", "images", "Asian_longhorned_beetle_1000.jpg"),
                        here("Lab2_phenology_models", "images", "ALB_damage.jpg")))
```

#### **Degree-Day Model**

**(10)** Ddevelop a degree-day Model for Asian longhorned beetle. (6 pts)

First, import weather data for Corvallis in 2021 derived from an Agrimet station (station ID = CRVO). Use the examples above to do this, or use your own method.

```{r}
# Import and format weather data
# First line is skipped because it's descriptive info (not data)

colnames(weath_data) <- c("month", "day", "tmax", "tmin", "prec", "dd50")

weath_data <- read_table(file = here("Lab2_phenology_models", "weather_data", "CRVO21.txt"),
                         skip = 1, col_names = FALSE,
                         col_types = cols(X7 = col_skip())) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  rename(c("month" = 1, "day" = 2, "tmax" = 3, "tmin" = 4, "prec" = 5, "dd50" = 6))
```

Below, create an empty data frame to store results of the DD model and define the number of days. 

```{r}
# Create an empty data frame to store accumulated DDs
out_all <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0))
colnames(out_all) <- c("month", "month_day", "dd_today", "dd_accum")

# Number of days for daily time step
number_of_days <- nrow(weath_data)
```

In the code chunk below, create the simple DD model for Asian long-horned beetle. The model for this species at [USPest.org](http://uspest.org) uses an LDT of 50F.

Remember to:  
(1) define the LDT (name it `LDT`)   
(2) initialize an object for DD accumulation (`dd_accum`)  
(3) use a `for` loop for the daily time step  
(4) include informative comments (as in Lab 2)  

Run the model when you're done.

```{r}
# Insert your code here
LDT <- 50

# Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
dd_accum <- 0

# Step through days of year
for (i in 1:number_of_days) {

  # Tmin and Tmax for day of year
  tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
  tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
  
  # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
  dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT
  
  # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
  if (dd_today < 0) {
    dd_today <- 0
  }
  
  # Accumulate degree-days
  dd_accum <- dd_accum + dd_today
  
  # Put results for day in a data frame
  out_i <- data.frame("doy" = i,
                      "month" = weath_data$month[i],
                      "month_day" = weath_data$day[i],
                      "dd_today" = dd_today,
                      "dd_accum" = dd_accum)
  
  # Attach results for day to all results 
  out_all <- bind_rows(out_all, out_i) 
}

max(out_all$dd_accum)
```

#### **Get Dates of Phenological Events**

We'd like to know when to expected specific  phenological events for Asian longhorned beetle, particularly those that are relevant to its surveillance and management. According the USPest.org model, 1% adult emergence occurs at `806` DDs and 1st egg hatch occurs at `1438` DDs. On which dates would these events occur in 2021 according to our simple model? To address this question, we can use the [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) and [`slice_min()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html) functions in the `dplyr` package to subset the rows of the `out_all` data frame in which `dd_accum` is closest to these values. The date (day of year) of the event is saved as a new object, `adult_emerg_doy`.

**(11)** Below is the code for 1% adult emergence. Repeat this step for 1st egg hatch, naming the two new objects `egg_hatch` and `egg_hatch_doy`. (1 pt)

```{r}
# Date of adult emergence
adult_emerg <- out_all %>%
  filter(dd_accum >= 806) %>% # subset rows where dd_accum >= 806
  slice_min(dd_accum) # keep row with values closest to 806
# View output
adult_emerg
# Day of year of event
adult_emerg_doy <- adult_emerg$doy

# Date of egg hatch
egg_hatch <- out_all %>%
  filter(dd_accum >= 1438) %>% # subset rows where dd_accum >= 1438
  slice_min(dd_accum) # keep row with values closest to 1438
egg_hatch
egg_hatch_doy <- egg_hatch$doy
```

#### **Plotting and Analysis**

We will create and save a plot of the results using the [`ggplot()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.4.0/topics/ggplot) function of the `ggplot2` package. A line plot is created using [`geom_line()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/1.0.1/topics/geom_line) to depict DD accumulation over the entire year.

First, we create a custom x-axis in which axis breaks correspond approximately with the first day of each month of the year (e.g., `1` = Jan 1, `32` = Feb 1, etc.). The custom x-axis labels `x_labels` present each break as the first of each month (e.g., `1-1`, `2-1`, etc.). This is created by using the [`paste()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/paste) function to literally paste together all unique months of the year present in the data (in the `out_all$month` column) to the number `1`. 

```{r}
# Create and save a simple plot
# New set of x-axis labels (dates vs. day of year)
days <- c(1, 32, 60, 91, 121, 152, 182, 213, 244, 274, 305, 335, 365)
x_labels <- paste(c(unique(out_all$month), 1), 1, sep = "-")
```

Next, we pass `out_all` to the `data` argument of the `ggplot` function, and  the `x` and `y` variables to be plotted (day of year and DD accumulation, respectively) within the aesthetic ([`aes()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/1.0.1/topics/aes)) function. A simple [plot theme](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html#ggplot2_themes) (`theme_bw`) is applied, titles for the x- and y-axis are added, and specifications are made for both axes. The `+` operator is used in `ggplot2` to add layers to plots. 

```{r}
# Plot
dd_plot <- ggplot(data = out_all, aes(x = doy, y = dd_accum)) +
  geom_line() + # for trend lines, time series, etc.
  theme_bw() + # simple black and white plot theme
  ylab("Cumulative DDs (LDT = 50F)") + # y-axis title
  xlab("Day of year - 2021") + # x-axis title
  # Both axes start at 0, x-axis uses custom breaks and labels
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = days, labels = x_labels) +
  # Make the y-axis 100 units larger than the max value in data
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     limits = c(0, max(out_all$dd_accum) + 100)) 

```

Now let's view the plot, and save it as a PNG file using `ggsave()`. 

```{r}
# View plot
dd_plot

# Save plot
ggsave(dd_plot, 
       filename = here("Lab2_phenology_models", "plots", "DDaccum_R.png"),
       height = 3, width = 5, units = c('in'), device = "png", dpi = 300)
```

We can depict the dates of phenological events on our plot with dashed red lines using the [`geom_vline()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/0.9.1/topics/geom_vline) function and label them using [`geom_text()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/0.9.1/topics/geom_text). The day of year for each phenological event is used to define x-intercepts for these geoms (the label is shifted 5 days later so it doesn't overlap with the line).

**(12)** The plot below shows the date for 1% adult emergence. Add the appropriate code to show the date for 1st egg hatch. (1 pt)

```{r}
dd_plot +
  geom_vline(xintercept = adult_emerg_doy, color ="red", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.75) +
  geom_text(aes(x = adult_emerg_doy + 5, label="1% Adult emerg.", y = 2200), colour="red", size = 4, angle=90) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = egg_hatch_doy, color ="red", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.75) +
  geom_text(aes(x = egg_hatch_doy + 5, label="1st Egg hatch", y = 2200), colour="red", size = 4, angle=90) 
```


### **Exercise 2: Annual Variation in Phenology**

In the next exercise, we'll expand on the example above by modeling phenology of Asian longhorned beetle across multiple years. The only differences in the model is that (1) weather data for multiple years are needed, and (2) a second `for` loop is needed to model phenology over multiple years **and** days. 

#### **Setup**

**(13)** First, we create a vector of years between `2012` and `2021`. Do this step yourself using the `:` operator and name the vector `years`. (1 pt)

```{r}
years <- c(2012:2021)
```

Next we create a vector that contains the name of weather data files for each year using the [`list.files()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/list.files) function. Weather data are from the same Corvallis weather station as above.

```{r}
all_files <- list.files(here("Lab2_phenology_models", "weather_data"))
all_files
```

Following the first example, we'll create an empty data frame to store the model results. However, this time the data frame will include a column named `year` so we can delineate which predictions correspond with which year. An empty data frame (`out_all2`) must be created each time before you run the model.

```{r}
out_all2 <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 5, nrow = 0))
colnames(out_all2) <- c("month", "day", "year", "dd_today", "dd_accum")
```

The loop for years starts with `1` and runs through all integer values up to the total number of years (`10`). A variable named `j` is used as an index that is iteratively replaced by each value in the vector `1:length(years)`. The [`length()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/length) function returns the length of vectors (or other object types), which in our case is `10`. So, `1:length(years)` returns all values between `1` and `10`.

```{r}
# Length of years
length(years)

#1:length of years
1:length(years)
```

#### **Multi-Year DD Model**

The entire multi-year DD model is below. I used the `supressWarnings()` function to hide some annoying warnings that were popping up when importing weather data.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
dd_accum <- 0

# Step through years
for (j in 1:length(years)) {
  
  # Weather data for year plus column names (skip column 7 with comments)
  weath_tbl <- suppressWarnings(read_table(file = here("Lab2_phenology_models", "weather_data", all_files[j]),
                         skip = 1, col_names = FALSE,
                         col_types = cols(X7 = col_skip())))
  weath_data <- data.frame(weath_tbl)
  colnames(weath_data) <- c("month", "day", "tmax", "tmin", "prec", "dd50")
  
  # Days of year in data (365 for non-leap years, 366 for leap years)
  number_of_days <- nrow(weath_data)
    
  # Initialize an object for degree-day accumulation
  dd_accum <- 0
  
  # Step through days (same daily loop as above)
  for (i in 1:number_of_days) {
  
    # Tmin and Tmax for day, but convert from degrees F to C
    tmax <- weath_data$tmax[i]
    tmin <- weath_data$tmin[i]
    
    # Use simple average DDs, more complex formulas are available and preferable
    dd_today <- (tmax + tmin)/2 - LDT
  
    # Can't have negative degree-days (change to 0)
    if (dd_today < 0) {
      dd_today <- 0
    }
  
    # Accumulate degree-days
    dd_accum <- dd_accum + dd_today

    # Add results to output data frame
    out_all2 <- rbind(
      out_all2, data.frame("doy" = i,
                         "month" = weath_data$month[i],
                         "day" = weath_data$day[i],
                         "year" = years[j],
                         "dd_today" = dd_today,
                         "dd_accum" = dd_accum)
      )
  }
  
}
```

**(14)** What is the purpose of nesting `for` loops in the above example? Why is better than running each year separately? (1 pt)

*Response*: We looped through years (n = 10) as well as the number of days (N = 365) for each year. For each year, degree-day accumulation is calculated. It would be much more laborious to run the loop separately for each year (~10X more code required). 

#### **Plotting and Analysis**

We'll use `ggplot2` again to plot and save the results. The only difference from above is that a `group` variable is defined as `year` within the aesthetic (`aes`) function. This tells `ggplot` that it needs to combine results for all years into a single plot. Additionally, the `color` variable in the aesthetic function tells `ggplot` to color lines by year. A custom color palette for the lines is applied using  [`scale_color_brewer()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html). 

One small edit is needed before plotting the result. Currently, the `year` column is in integer format, which causes `ggplot` to use a continuous color palette rather than a categorical color palette. We can solve this problem by converting `year` to a factor.

```{r}
str(out_all2)
out_all2$year <- factor(out_all2$year)
str(out_all2)
```

Create the plot.

```{r}
# Plot
dd_plot2 <- ggplot(data = out_all2, aes(x = doy, y = dd_accum, group = year, color = year)) +
  geom_line() + # for trend lines, time series, etc.
  theme_bw() + # simple black and white plot theme
  ylab("Cumulative DDs (LDT = 50F)") + # y-axis title
  xlab("Day of year") + # x-axis title
  # Custon color palette
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Spectral", direction = -1) +
  # Both axes start at 0, x-axis uses custom breaks and labels
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = days, labels = x_labels) +
  # Make the y-axis 100 units larger than the max value in data
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     breaks = seq(0, max(out_all2$dd_accum), 400),
                     limits = c(0, max(out_all2$dd_accum) + 100)) 

```

View the plot and save it as a PNG file. Note: if you're getting strange results, make sure that your data frame has only 3653 rows (this indicates the model was run only a single time). 

```{r}
dd_plot2

# Save plot
ggsave(dd_plot2, 
       filename = here("Lab2_phenology_models", "plots", "DDaccum_10yr_R.png"),
       height = 3, width = 5, units = c('in'), device = "png", dpi = 300)

```

To determine the predicted dates of 1st egg hatch by Asian longhorn beetle over the 10 year period, the `filter()` function is again used to subset the rows of the `out_all2` data frame in which `dd_accum` is closest to `1438`. However, the `group_by()` function in the `dplyr` package is used to group the output by the `year` column before filtering because we're interested in knowing dates for every single year. 

```{r}
egg_hatch2 <- out_all2 %>%
  group_by(year) %>% # group by year
  filter(dd_accum >= 1438) %>% # subset rows where dd_accum >= 1438
  slice_min(dd_accum) # keep row with values closest to 1438
egg_hatch2
```

**(15)** On which years was 1st egg hatch predicted to be earliest vs. latest? What does this tell you about the temperatures on those two years? (1 pt)  

*Response*: Earliest in 2015 (7/30) and latest in 2012 (8/22). These results suggest that 2015 had warmer temperatures than other years, whereas 2012 had cooler temperatures, at least during the period in which the insect was developing.


**(16)** Compare your results for *3 years* (e.g., 2019, 2020, and 2021) to those produced by the USPest.org model. Follow these instructions: (5 pts)  

(a) Visit the model app at [USPest.org](https://uspest.org/dd/model_app).  
(b) In the Station tab, type in CRVO and select this station.    
(c) In the Model tab, select "asian longhorned beetle" and enter a Start Date of January 1 for each of your chosen years. Keep default values for other options.  
(d) Click on the Output tab and check the "show model inputs table" in the Model Inputs section.    
(e) Look at the Model Output section (you can also look at the graph) and document the date of 1st egg hatch for the given year.        

According to the USPest.org model, when did 1st egg hatch occur for each of your 3 chosen years? Are these dates earlier or later than dates predicted by your model (i.e., dates in `egg_hatch2`)? Optional: enter a code chunk below if it helps in making comparisons. 

*Response*: 
USPEST
2012: 8-14 
2013: 7-30
2014: 7-28

vs. Our model
2012: 8-22
2013: 8-6
2014: 8-5

The simple average model consistently predicts later dates than single sine model. On average, by about 1 week.

```{r}
sine <- as.Date(c("8/14/2012", "7/30/2013", "7/28/2014"), "%m/%d/%Y")
simple <- as.Date(c("8/22/2012", "8/6/2013", "8/5/2014"), "%m/%d/%Y")
diff <- sine - simple
```

**(17)** The model at USPest.org uses the single sine formula to calculate degree-days. This method uses the day's $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$ to produce a sine curve over a 24-hour period, and then estimates DDs for that day by calculating the area above the threshold and below the curve. Why is this method likely to be more accurate than the simple average method used in our model? (1 pt)

*Response*: On days when the outside air temperature crosses the base temperature, the accuracy of the simple average method is typically very poor. For locations with temperatures that hover around the base temperature, it will typically underestimate degree days significantly. The impact of this inaccuracy depends on the climate and the choice of base temperature.


**(18)** Name at least one potential source of error in predicting phenology. (1 pt)

*Response*: Biotic factors (e.g., host species, predators, parasites, disease), non-temperature abiotic factors (e.g., photoperiod, moisture), nonlinear relationship between temperature and development, organism experiences different temperatures than air temperatures used in model (due to microhabitats, behavior, etc.), other acceptable answers.


**(19)** As this exercise demonstrated, the timing of phenological events can vary across years. Think of your favorite ecological system and describe how a phenology model might help you make better management decisions. For example, you might think about applications for invasive species, species of conservation concern, or farming.  (2 pts)

*Response*: Answers may vary but must be reasonable and specific. 


**(20)** Discuss your overall results from the phenology model exercises. Rather than repeating specific results, review the most important things that you learned from the lab (4 pts).  

*Response*: Answers may vary but must be at least a few sentences long and state specific things about what they learned.
