## What is R?

- First implemented beginning in early 1990s (based on S language)  
- First designed for statistics but can now do much more  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "1000px", fig.align="left", fig.cap = "Source: blog.internshala.com"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "What-is-R.jpg"))
```

## Why learn R?

- Commonly used programming language   
- Does more than just statistics  
- Great for reproducibility  
- Interdisciplinary and extensible  
- Large and friendly user community  
- Facilitates learning and comprehension  

## R is a commonly used programming language

knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "0Advantages-of-R-Programming.jpg"))
```

## R is great for reproducibility

- No need to remember a series of points and clicks   
- Quickly re-create plots, re-run models and analyses, etc. 
- Makes steps used in your analysis clear  
- Can be inspected by someone for feedback  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px", fig.align="left", fig.cap = "Source: www.cos.io"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "open_research.jpg"))
```

- Hands-on work with your data, analyses, etc., provides more in depth understanding  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "data_science.png"))
```

## Limitations of R

- Steep learning curve, but `RStudio` can help overcome this limitation  
- Hungry for physical memory: stores all data in physical memory  
- Slower execution: sometimes not as fast as MATLAB and Python  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "limitations.png"))
```

Even after years of experience with R, I have days where I....

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "bang-head-rough-week.gif"))
```

## RStudio

- Re-branded as Posit (more inclusive of other programming langs)
- Free and open source IDE (integrated development environment)  
- Many convenient features and tools that make it easier to
  - write and troubleshoot code  
  - interact with objects in the R environment  
  - simultaneously view graphs, data tables, code, and outputs  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "R_RStudio.png"))

:::

::::

## RStudio: **Source** (top-left) pane

- Your scripts or other files (e.g., R Markdown files)  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "RStudio_IDE_screenshot_source.png"))
```

## RStudio: **Environment/History** (top-right) pane

- Objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "RStudio_IDE_screenshot_enviro.png"))
```

## RStudio: **Files/Plots/Packages/etc.** pane (bottom-right)

- Files, plots, etc. in your directories (in Jupyter Hub)  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "RStudio_IDE_screenshot_plot.png"))
```

## RStudio: R **Console** (bottom-left)

- Provides an area to interactively execute code (but won't be saved!)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "RStudio_IDE_screenshot_console.png"))
```

## Learning objectives

- Explain what R and RStudio are, what they are used for, and how they relate to each other  
- Describe the purpose of the Script, Console, Environment, and Plots panes in RStudio  
- **Create an R project and understand the purpose of the working directory**  
- Copy a folder of files on Jupyter Hub and open them in RStudio

## Create an R project for this course

1. Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio1.png"))
```

## Create an R project for this course

2. Choose `New Directory`  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio2.png"))
```

## Create an R project for this course

3. Select `New Project` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio3.png"))
```

## Create an R project for this course

4. Type `Labs` in the Directory name box

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio4.png"))
```

## Create an R project for this course

5. You should now see a `Labs.Rproj` file in the Files/Plots/Packages/etc. pane

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio5.png"))
```

## The working directory

- The `Labs` folder, where you put your R project, will be your **working directory**  
- To see this, type in `getwd()` in the R console  
- It should return `/home/username/Labs`  (username is your ONID)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio6.png"))
```

## Why are we doing this?

- You must open your R project prior to opening a lab assignment (more on this later)  
- All code within the `Labs` directory can use *relative paths* to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located  
- The use of projects and relative paths makes sharing code with others easier  
- It's also less laborious than typing out *absolute paths* (i.e., the full path to your directory)

## Learning objectives

- Explain what R and RStudio are, what they are used for, and how they relate to each other  
- Describe the purpose of the Script, Console, Environment, and Plots panes in RStudio  
- Create an R project and understand the purpose of the working directory    
- **Copy a folder of files on Jupyter Hub and open them in RStudio**

## Copying tutorials/lab assignments

- NOTE: Instructions presented here are available in Canvas
- Go to `Modules` -> `Jupyter Hub` -> `Copying_files.pdf`

## Copying tutorials/lab assignments

- All files that involved the use of R will be in `hub_data_share` in Jupyter Hub  
- You will need to copy folders with these files to your own account  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1","images", "copy_labs_1.png"))
```

## Copy folder using Terminal in RStudio

Open up RStudio and click on the Terminal tab in the Console pane (bottom-left)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1","images", "copy_labs_2.png"))
```

## Copy folder using Terminal in RStudio

Type in the following command in the terminal:

`cp -ur $HOME/hub_data_share/Intro_to_R_part1 $HOME/Labs/`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1","images", "copy_labs_3.png"))
```

- `cp` copies files and directories  
- `-u` option indicates copying only new and missing files to the destination  
- `-r` option indicates drilling down through the directory structure  
- `$HOME` is the path to your home directory, which is `/home/your_onid`  

## Copy folder using Terminal in RStudio

- If it worked correctly, you should see the `Intro_R_Part1` folder  
- (In the `Files` tab of the Files/Plots/Packages/etc. pane)  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "copy_labs_4.png"))
```

## Open your project and load some files

- We will be using the `Labs` project (`Labs.proj`) for all tutorials and lab assignments  
- In RStudio, if you're project isn't already open, click on `File` -> `Open Project`  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio7.png"))
```


## Open your project and load some files

- Your project may already open - check in the upper right corner  
- If not, open your project (`Labs.proj`)  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio8.png"))
```


## Open an R script

- Click on `Open File` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio9.png"))
```

## Open an R script

- Click on `Open File` 
- Navigate to `Home` -> `Labs` -> `Tutorials` -> `Intro_R_part1` -> `scripts`  
- Select the `here_example.R` script

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio10.png"))
```


## The `here` package

- For this class, we will use the `here` package to use project-relative paths  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio11.png"))
```

## The `here` package

- For this class, we will use the `here` package to use project-relative paths  
- Select all text in the script by pressing `Ctrl + A` 
- Click on the `Run` button on the Source pane  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio12.png"))
```

## Output in the Console pane

- Line 6 of the code was the project-relative path to `file.txt`  
- Line 9 read the lines of `file.txt` using `readLines()` (see result in console)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part1", "images", "JH_RStudio13.png"))
```
