## Active participation (optional)

- Open RStudio in Jupyter Hub  
- In the Files/Plots/etc. pane, navigate to: `$HOME/Labs/Intro_R_part3/`  
- Click on `Intro_to_R_part3_codingEtiquette.rmd`  
- File should open in the Source pane  
- Run the code chunks, add to chunks, or type code in Console  

## Learning objectives

- Describe several types of best coding practices  
- Apply this knowledge in your code for this course  
  - Lab assignments  
  - Class project  
 
## Overview: best coding practices

1. Abide by the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle  
2. Follow some easy-to-remember naming convention  
3. Keep the code as straightforward as possible  
4. Limit the length of a line of code  
5. Use comments frequently  
6. Use consistent indentation  
7. Whenever and wherever possible, avoid deep nesting  

## 1. DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}  

- Don’t write the same code repeatedly  
- Example shows duplicate C# code  
- Instead, write and re-use functions (more on this later)  

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="right"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part3", "images", "repeating_code.png"))
```

## 2. Easy-to-remember naming convention

- Use descriptive and succinct names for all objects  
- Good: Underscores (“_”), periods (“.”), or combo of upper and lower case  
- Avoid: Uninformative names  
- Fail: Spaces and certain symbols such as “/”  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "1000px", fig.caption = "Modified from: dataquest.io"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part3", "images", "good_names.png"))
```

## 3. Straightforward and succint code

- Nobody want to read messy code, including your future self  
- Would you want to look at this? 

```{r, `code-line-numbers`="1-4", eval = FALSE}
# Not-so-good 
for (i in 1:nrow(df <- data.frame(x=c(1, 2, 3, 4)))) { print(df[i,])} 
  lst = list(data.frame(y=c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10), z = c(2,2,2,2,2)), 
             m = matrix(5,5, nrow=5))

# Better
df <- data.frame(x = c(1:4))
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  print(df[i,])
}
df2 <- data.frame(y = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10), z = c(rep(2, 5)))
mat <- matrix(5, 5, nrow = 5)
lst <- list(df2, mat)
```

## 3. Straightforward and succint code

- Use multiple lines to create new objects, etc. 
- Reduce text using operators and functions (e.g., `:` and `rep()`)  

```{r, `code-line-numbers`="6-13", eval = FALSE}
# Not-so-good 
for (i in 1:nrow(df <- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4)))) { print(df[i,])} 
  lst = list(data.frame(y=c(6,7,8,9,10), z = c(2,2,2,2,2)), 
             m = matrix(5,5, nrow=5))

# Better
df <- data.frame(x = c(1:4))
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  print(df[i,])
}
df2 <- data.frame(y = c(6:10), z = c(rep(2, 5)))
mat <- matrix(5, 5, nrow = 5)
lst <- list(df2, mat)
```

## 4. Limit the length of a line of code 
 
- Again, short lines of code are easier to read and understand  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Not-so-good 
for (i in 1:nrow(df <- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4)))) { print(df[i,])} 
  lst = list(data.frame(y=c(6,7,8,9,10), z = c(2,2,2,2,2)), 
             m = matrix(5,5, nrow=5))

# Better
df <- data.frame(x = c(1:4))
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  print(df[i,])
}
df2 <- data.frame(y = c(6:10), z = c(rep(2, 5)))
mat <- matrix(5, 5, nrow = 5)
lst <- list(df2, mat)
```

## 5. Use comments frequently

- Allows for explanations, instructions, etc. for analyses   
- Your future self and others who review your code will thank you  
- Especially important if code is in a script (rather than R Markdown)    

```{r}
# This is a script for degree-day modeling
# Author: Brittany Barker
# Last updated: Jan 13, 2024
library(here) # Useful for project-relevant paths

# Lower developmental threshold (base 50F)
LDT50 <- 50

# Create an empty data frame to store results
out_all <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0))

# Etc, etc.
```

## 6. Use consistent indentation 

- Use tabs, not spaces  
- Helps keep track of nested code blocks     
- RStudio will auto-indent!     

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Notice the 4 levels of indentation
years <- 2022:2023
days <- 1:3
# Loop through each year in `years`
for (year in years) {
  if (year %% 2 == 0) {
    # Next loop through each day
    for (day in days) {
      msg <- paste("Day", day, "in", year)
      print(msg)
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Avoid deep nesting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}  

- Keep control structures short  
- Easier to trouble-shoot when code breaks  
- Increases readability and helps avoid unwanted results  
- Pyramid Of Doom: an unwieldy number of nested conditional statements or functions

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height="800px", out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Intro_R_part3", "images", "deep_nesting.jpg"))
```
