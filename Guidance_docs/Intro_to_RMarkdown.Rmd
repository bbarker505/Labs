### **Learning objectives**

- Become familiar with the R Markdown syntax and code chunk rules  
- Understand how to include figures and tables in your Markdown reports  
- Create R Markdown files and export them to HTML and Microsoft Word files  

### **Why R Markdown?**

All lab assignments will be completed within an R Markdown document. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it, a bit like a notebook. This can make it easier for the instructors to present instructions, code, and other content for each lab. For students, R Markdown can makes it easier to integrate R code with their written explanations, such as answers to questions. 

This file provides an overview of R Markdown. If you're reading a knitted version of this document (e.g., under the "Jupyter Hub, R, and RStudio - Resources" module in Canvas), the `.Rmd` file that was used to create it was provided to you in Week 2 of class (`Intro_to_RMarkdown.Rmd`). 

Note: Some of the below content was borrowed from a tutorial about R Markdown at [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown/).  

### **The YAML header**

At the top of an R Markdown document, there is a YAML header section enclosed by `---`. By default, it includes a title, author, date and the file type you want to output to. For this class, you will produce HTML (`.html`) and MS Word (`.docx`) documents. The instructors may return the Word document back to you with comments. Make sure to replace "Your name" with your actual name. The "date" will be automatically generated using the `Sys.Date()` function, which returns the current date. 

### **Knitting a document**

When you click the **Knit** button (ball of blue yarn with a needle through it), a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. By default, I set up R Markdown files to knit to an HTML file; however, you can knit other formats by clicking the drop-down menu next to the knit button. **Please remember to knit your assignments to MS Word files**. 

### **Code chunks**

The first code chunk in R Markdown may contain R packages that are needed to run your code. For this file, we use the `here()` and `knitr()` packages.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

When working through your lab assignment, you can run the code for an individual chunk by clicking the green "play button" triangle in the top-right corner of the chunk. To run multiple chunks, click on the `Run` button in the top-right corner of the "Source" pane in RStudio, and select your preference (e.g., restart R and run all chunks, or run all chunks above). You can run individual lines of code within chunks by selecting `Run selected lines` or using the keyboard shortcut (on Windows) `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`. See the screenshot below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "250px", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Tutorials", "Guidance_docs", "images", "RMarkdown_run_chunk.png"))
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You might want to create an object, but not include both the code and the output in the final `.html` file. To do this you can use, include = FALSE. Be aware though, when making reproducible research itâ€™s often not a good idea to completely hide some part of your analysis.

```{r cars, include = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

To insert an external figure, you can use the `include_graphics` function in the `knitr` R package, as shown above in the screenshot of the run options.

There are several options for inserting tables.

One is the `kable()` function from the `knitr` package. Also checkout the `gt()` function in the `gt` package and the `pander()` function in the `pander` package.

```{r}
kable(pressure)
```

You can manually create small tables using R Markdown syntax. For example:

| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |

There are several other code chunk instructions that you could learn about (see **R Markdown Resources** below). 

### **Formatting text**

Once you knit your document, the output will display text formatted according to the following simple rules.

*Italic*

Italic

**Bold**

Bold

This is `code` in text

# Header 1

Header 1
## Header 2

Header 2
Note that when a # symbol is placed inside a code chunk it acts as a normal R comment, but when placed in text it controls the header size.

* Unordered list item

$A = \pi \times r^{2}$

Rendered equation example

The $ symbols tells R markdown to use LaTeX equation syntax.

### **Practice**

To practice this, try writing some formatted text in your `.Rmd` document, add some additional code, and produce an `.html` and `.docx` file using the `Knit` button.
